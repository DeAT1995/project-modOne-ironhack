### Introduction

* Project module 1, Web Development course Ironhack wdpt may 2021.

* The game is inspired by the news about President Bolsonaro and his scene in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic displaying a box of the drug chloroquine for an emu.
Emu is the last of its kind living in the LIZARB country. With the spread of a virus starting a pandemic in his homeland, networks were stunned by untrue news. One of this information that was disseminated by the crazy president of his country directed that the proper treatment to end the health crisis would be to feed the emus with the drug chloroquine, causing all of their kind to die intoxicated. Help Emu not have the same end as his companions by escaping from chloroquines and capturing the real solution to end the virus that is vaccines.
